# <Horiseon-Social-Solution-Services-Demo>

## Description
The goal of this Horiseon Social Solution Services Demo was to display what Horiseon can do for the customers potentially looking to use Horiseon as an asset for their buisness. 
We built this project to show Horiseon how their own personal webpage would look.
It solves the problem of Horiseon not having any sort of online prescence for their potential customers.
I learned to structure html and css more semantically on this project.
